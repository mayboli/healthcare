Correlations between Income and Healthcare

After pulling in health data from a CSV using d3, I plotted the data points of all the states with percentage in poverty against percentage lacking healthcare to look for a correlation. There is a strong correlation between poverty and the lack of healthcare. As the percentage in poverty rises, the percentage lacking healthcare also goes up.

However, there is an outlier, Massachusetts has a high poverty rate, but there is a low percentage lacking healthcare. So, what is the reason behind this? I did a search on Google and discovered that Massachusetts has the highest healthcare cost, but also the least amount of people lacking healthcare. How can this be? Apparently they have adopted new techniques such as implementing new payment systems that control costs and improve the rate at which patients receive care.

Another outlier is Texas, the percentage lacking healthcare is extremely high. According to articles on Google, it seems that the insurance plans are skimpy and its hard to qualify under government funded plans.
