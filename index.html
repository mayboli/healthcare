          <h2>Correlations Between Income and Healthcare</h2>
          <p>After pulling in data from a CSV using d3, I plotted the data points of all the states with percentage
            in poverty against percentage lacking healthcare to look for a correlation. There is a strong correlation 
            between poverty and the lack of healthcare. As the percentage in poverty rises, the percentage lacking 
            healthcare also goes up.
          </p>

          <p>
            However, there is an outlier, Massachusetts has a high poverty rate, but there is a low percentage lacking
            healthcare. So, what is the reason behind this? I did a search on Google and discovered that Massachusetts
            has the highest healthcare cost, but also the least amount of people lacking healthcare. How can this be? 
            Apparently they have adopted new techniques such as implementing new payment systems that control costs
            and improve the rate at which patients receive care. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Another outlier is Texas, the percentage lacking healthcare is extremely high. According to articles on 
            Google, it seems that the insurance plans are skimpy and its hard to qualify under government funded plans.
